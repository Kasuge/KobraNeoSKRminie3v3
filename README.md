# KobraNeoSKRminie3v3
Firmware for Anycubic Kobra neo with BTT SKR mini e3 v3 + BLTouch (3dTouch)
Used Marlin 2.0.1 bugfix-2.1.x firmware for Bigtreetech SKR mini E3 V3 + BTT TFT 35 v3 board. Based on the original firmware from Anycubic Kobra neo.
The files contain the latest version of the compiled firmware, but could not complete it.
Main problems: 1. Large accelerations when calibrating the table. 2. The Z limit switch is working (BLTouch), but when leveling the hotbed, it goes into error (does not go lower).
